For my research portion, I looked at an Article called "The Portfolio Organizer" in which a criteria of 17 things is provided for what makes a good portfolio,
<p> the reader is encouraged to pick the most relevant points to their field of study and use those so the six criteria that I chose are; </p>
<p> completeness, knowledge of content, accuracy of information, self-assessment and goal setting, variety of entries and visual appeal.</p>
<p> I think that my portfolio is complete and that I have enough knowledge of the content so far, I have set goals in the portfolio, </p>
<p> I do have a variety of different entries although the visual appeal is very basic and clunky.</p>
